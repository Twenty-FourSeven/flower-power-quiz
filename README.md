## Description

An application that will hopefully broaden your understanding of Hawaiian culture.

This challenge involved creating a timed quiz, which required an understanding of programming concepts such as query selectors, event listeners, JSON, and local storage. 

Through the process of creating this quiz, I learned how to use query selectors to target specific webpage elements, how to implement event listeners to handle and respond to user input, and how to store and retrieve data via JSON.

Furthermore, in producing this quiz, I learned how to create functions to handle user input, display questions, and calculate scores.
